TerrainApp - A procedural 2D tilemap generator.

Requires Python 2.7 with the Pyglet, cocos2D and noise libraries.

Instructions:
-Run main.py to launch.
- Press "V" to zoom out and view entire map.

Recent Changes:
- Added basic camera panning.
- Map now generates vegetation at surface and ore deposits beneath ground level.

TODO:
- Stop player rotation, and fix angle when map rotates and player lands.
- Disable grass shrub and cave tile collisions.
- Generate cave tile instead of air tile when destroying block at cave level.
- Dynamically load tiles at runtime so map size is much bigger.
- Make the noise input variables random.
