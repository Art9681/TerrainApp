TerrainApp - A procedural 2D tilemap generator.

Requires Python 2.7 with the Pyglet, cocos2D and noise libraries.

Instructions:
-Run main.py to launch.

Controls:
A to move left.
D to move right.
SPACE to jump.
V to zoom out map. (Cannot zoom back in yet!)
E to rotate map +90 degrees (unfinished, experimenting with this feature. Use at own risk.

Recent Changes:
- Can rotate map and physics respond accordingly.
- Added player object.
- Added pymunk physics.
- Can destroy blocks on mouse click.
- Map now generates vegetation at surface and ore deposits beneath ground level.

TODO:
- Dynamically load tiles at runtime so map size is much bigger. Use generators?
- Make the noise input variables random.
- Save/Load map menu.
